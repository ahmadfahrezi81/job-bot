I'm applying for Intermediate Front End Developer at Crimson Education. I optimized a Next.js service to drive 137\%  organic traffic growth in 6 months.

At CommerceOwl, I built ImagineAPI using Next.js and TypeScript, implementing dynamic sitemaps and structured metadata to boost organic traffic by 137\%  and elevate search ranking from  \#5 to  \#2. I enforced accessibility standards to achieve 95+ Lighthouse scores, ensuring responsive, WCAG-compliant interfaces. In the TeaPOS project, I architected a multi-tenant POS platform with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui, reducing transaction latency by 35\%  and cutting UI redundancy by 25\%  through a shared TypeScript component library. I integrated GitHub Actions CI/CD for automated previews and tests, speeding deployments by 80\%  while maintaining pixel-perfect fidelity to designs.

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my UI craftsmanship, performance optimization, and accessibility expertise can elevate Crimson Education's front end experiences. I'd ensure seamless, precise translation of Figma designs into production-ready components.
