Dear Hiring Manager,

Your team's work on scaling GoPay for millions of daily transactions caught my attention. I've spent the last two years at Grab building and running production-grade Python automation suites that keep critical payment flows stable, and I see clear ways to support GoTo Financial's mission in the SDET - User Spend role.

At Grab, I authored and maintained 22 automation scripts using Python, Selenium and Appium. I led regression cycles for each release, logged quantitative quality metrics, and partnered with PMs and designers to define edge-case coverage. Those efforts cut manual regression time by 40\%  and surfaced critical issues before every release.

I routinely collaborate across teams to clarify requirements and triage bugs. While I've focused on UI and end-to-end flows, I'm quickly ramping up Postman for API testing and sharpening my SQL skills to validate backend data. I monitor CI jobs in Jenkins, debug flaky failures, and suggest process tweaks to improve stability.

I welcome the chance to discuss how my automation background and proactive ownership can drive reliable releases for GoPay users. Thank you for your time and consideration, and I look forward to connecting.
