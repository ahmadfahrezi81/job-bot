Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the [Job Title] role. As a Computer Science student at the University of Malaya with hands-on experience at Grab and CommerceOwl, I enjoy solving real engineering challenges and building reliable, user-focused systems.

At Grab, I built an AI-driven test automation system that sped up test creation by 60\% and delivered 22 production-ready scripts using Python, Appium, and Selenium. Working closely with product and engineering teams taught me how solid QA processes directly support scalability and user trust---skills I'm eager to bring to [Company Name].

%-------------------------
% BODY PARAGRAPH 2

Beyond QA, I've contributed to full-stack projects that focus on performance and usability. At CommerceOwl, I developed and tested web apps across React, Next.js, and Vue.js with 95\%+ coverage, helping increase conversion rates by 32\%. More recently, I built TeaPOS, a multi-tenant SaaS POS platform with Next.js and PostgreSQL, featuring role-based access control and enterprise-grade data security.

%-------------------------
% BODY PARAGRAPH 3 (Optional)
%-------------------------
I'm drawn to [specific aspect of company or team] because it aligns with my passion for building meaningful, scalable technology. I enjoy collaborating with people who care about quality and user experience as much as I do.
